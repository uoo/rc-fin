Radio remote controlled Yondu fin lights

The fin lights are comprised of a power source, CPU with radio transceiver, and a "DotStar" style APA102 addressable LED strip.

The remote contains another CPU/radio board, power source, and a momentary contact pushbutton switch.

The CPUs for both parts are the same, a Moteino with a RFM69CW 915MHz transceiver on board:

The LED strip is one of the AdaFruit 144 LED/m strips.  A short length is sufficient, a half meter strip can provide enough LEDs for three fins.

Another option is 200 LED/m strips using smaller 2mm APA102 chips, the higher density allows for a smoother effect, but it takes longer to ship and shipping is expensive:
